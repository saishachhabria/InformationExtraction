Issues:
1.  [Fixed] Environment ---> make sure java is installed

2.  Need Python 3.7 <= and Spacy 2.1 >= 

3.  Need Ubuntu with decent memory allocation (preferably GPU)

4.  Preprocessing (Data Cleaning)
    Text simplification --- most implementations need gpu --- long time to train

5.  Coreference resolution --> ran into a memory issue

6.  [Fixed] Change .process.sh ---> depending on how python is called on the system
